Input Layers:

Multiple input streams (text, images, etc.), each with a dedicated LLM to process and contextualize into “facts.”
Each LLM is pre-prompted with instructions for interpreting its input type.
Short-Term Fact Buffer:

A simple memory store that temporarily holds recent facts from all input streams.
Another LLM periodically reads these facts and assigns emotional deltas (based on a stored emotional quadrant state).
Emotional State & Quadrant:

Maintain a vector representing emotional state.
A small LLM (or a simple function) calculates emotional shifts based on the current facts and queries long-term memory for related patterns.
Long-Term Memory:

A vector database or embedding store for facts and their emotional weights.
On each cycle, facts that closely resemble existing patterns increment those patterns’ weights; unmatched facts stay transient.
Sleep Cycle:

After N cycles, simulate “sleep” by:
Randomly sampling heavily weighted short-term and long-term facts.
Process them again at reduced emotional impact (e.g., 10% weight).
Update emotional state and store any new patterns to long-term memory.
Modular Orchestration:

Use a controller script to coordinate:
Input processing LLMs
Short-term and long-term memory steps
Emotional state updates
Periodic “sleep” routines
By composing LLMs with predefined prompts for each role (fact extraction, emotional scoring, pattern matching), and using a central orchestrator that feeds data into these roles in sequence, you can approximate the desired cognitive model with manageable complexity.
